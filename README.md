# Nitin Jethava - Submission

This repository contains my solutions for the technical interview, covering multiple topics including Embedded C, C language, OpenCV, Python and Linux. The code is organized into relevant folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific topic. Please review the code and implementations based on the interview requirements.

## Repository Structure
- **Embedded C**: Solutions related to embedded systems programming.
- **C Language**: C programming solutions and examples.
- **OpenCV**: Code for computer vision tasks.
- **Python**: Python-based solutions and examples.
- **Linux**: Linux-related code and commands.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-link>
    ```
2. Navigate to the relevant folder based on the topic.
3. Follow the instructions within the respective code files.

## Index
1) **Embedded C**
    - Q1.1) Write an Embedded C program to multiply any number by 9 in the fastest manner.
    - Q1.2) Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 1000 without using relational operators.
    - Q1.3) Write a MIN macro program that takes two arguments and returns the smallest of both arguments.
    - Q1.4) Write a C program to toggle a specific bit (e.g., bit 3) of an 8-bit unsigned integer without changing the other bits. Implement the program using bitwise operations.
    - Q1.5) Program to Add Two Complex Numbers
    - Q1.6) Write a simplified Algorithm as code, a hardware-independent Embedded C program using FreeRTOS that accomplishes the following: Create three tasks:
        - FrameCaptureTask (Priority: High)
        - FaceRecognitionTask (Priority: Medium)
        - LoggerTask (Priority: Low)

2) **C/C++ Language**
    - Q2.1) Write a program to implement a stack that allows users to perform push, pop, and display operations on it.
    - Q2.2) Write a program to convert 545 numbers from Decimal to Binary.
    - Q2.3) Find the GCD of two numbers.
    - Q2.4) Reverse and uppercase a string (C++ Console Program).
    - Q2.5) Write a C++ program to check whether a number is even or odd without using `%` or `/`.

3) **OpenCV**
    - Q3.1) Play a video using OpenCV (external camera).
    - Q3.2) Find circles and ellipses in an image using OpenCV.

4) **Python**
    - Q4.1) Factorial program in Python.
    - Q4.2) Automorphic number or not. For example, 5 is an automorphic number.
    - Q4.3) Print the following pattern.
    - Q4.4) Implement a stack using class (push, pop operations).
    - Q4.5) Find all unique combinations in a set of candidate numbers that sum to a target.
    - Q4.6) Return all possible permutations of a collection of numbers.

5) **Linux**
    - Q5.1) Create a new folder "test_new" in the home directory.
    - Q5.2) Remove all permissions of the "test_new" directory.
    - Q5.3) Create a "new.txt" file in the "test_new" directory.
    - Q5.4) Delete the "test_new" directory.

### Optional: 
#### What is the "Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)" Principle?

The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is a fundamental rule in programming that says:  
"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

In simple words:  
➔ Don’t write the same code again and again.  
Instead, write it once and reuse it wherever needed.
